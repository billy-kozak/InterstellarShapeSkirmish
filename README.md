Interstellar Shape Skirmish
===========================

This code was from our final engineering design project at the University
of Alberta. Initially made to run on an Altera NIOS II with an associated
motion controller, I have ported it to run on windows.

# Building
Unfortunatley, this project does not build at this time. In the future, I plan
to port this to run on Linux and add a proper Makefile.

Although this code was originally meant to run on Windows, I expect that I will
drop the support.
